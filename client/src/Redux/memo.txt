https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn9Y76Naw_U

#1
Redux
/actions
../x
../y

/constants
../x
../y

/reducers
../x
../y

pros: organized, standard
cons: every reducer = 3 files => complex
      third party library(ie. redux-saga) => messy


###

#2 ducks
every single reducer = 1 file

Redux
x.js
y.js

pros: less file, easy to work
cons: long, complex reducer = 1 long file
      => make seperate reducers
